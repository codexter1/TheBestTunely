# Tunely Music Project
---
Welcome to Rey and Tom's Tunely Music App Project. This app provides the user with an easy way to listen to their favorite music albums and songs. It also provides a way to add new music and albums, remove music or albums or even update existing music or albums. We hope you enjoy using our Tunely Music app.

# Objectives
---
To allow users to listen to, add, update and remove their favorite music albums through an easy to use interface.

# Motivation
---
There are dozens of music apps on the market now and each has it's own benefits. With almost all of these requiring you sign up and provide a payment method, we thought it would be nice to have a simple to use app so you, or any of your family and friends, could quickly get access to shared music files.
